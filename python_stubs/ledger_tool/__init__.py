"""Python stub for crate `ledger-tool`.

The ``ledger-tool`` binary provides a command line interface for
interrogating an on-disk ledger.  In Python this would typically be
exposed via a ``main()`` function that parses ``argparse`` arguments and
invokes the relevant ledger operations.  Consult ``ledger-tool/src`` for
the available subcommands.
