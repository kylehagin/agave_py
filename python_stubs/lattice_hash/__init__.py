"""Python stub for crate `lattice-hash`.

The Rust crate implements an incremental lattice based hash using the
``blake3`` algorithm.  The Python equivalent would expose a ``LtHash``
class with ``identity()``, ``mix_in()``, ``mix_out()`` and ``checksum()``
methods.  Refer to ``lattice-hash/src/lt_hash.rs`` for the complete
implementation.
