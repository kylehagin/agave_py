"""Python stub for crate `net-shaper`.

The ``net-shaper`` binary configures traffic shaping rules using system
utilities such as ``tc`` and ``iptables``.  A Python CLI could provide
similar functionality via ``subprocess`` calls based on
``argparse``-parsed options.  See ``net-shaper/src/main.rs`` for the
reference implementation.
