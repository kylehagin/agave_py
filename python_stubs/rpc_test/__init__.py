"""Simplified utilities for testing RPC components.

This module emulates a very small portion of the Rust `rpc-test` crate.  It
provides a :class:`MockRPC` object that can register Python callables as RPC
methods and invoke them synchronously.  Network and concurrency behaviour of the
original crate are not implemented; this is purely an inâ€‘process dispatcher used
for unit tests.
