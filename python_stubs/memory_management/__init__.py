"""Python stub for crate `memory-management`.

The Rust crate provides helpers for working with aligned memory blocks.
See ``memory-management/src`` for details.  A Python implementation
could offer functions like ``is_memory_aligned`` and an ``AlignedMemory``
class wrapping ``bytearray`` with alignment guarantees.
