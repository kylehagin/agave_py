"""Python stub for crate `ledger`.

This crate contains the on-disk ledger format and utility functions for
managing it.  The Python stub does not implement the storage layer but
serves as a placeholder for APIs such as blockstore access or snapshot
handling.  See ``ledger/src`` for the full Rust implementation.
